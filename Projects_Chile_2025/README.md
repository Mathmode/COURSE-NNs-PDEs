During the course, we will provide an overview of how to use NN to solve PDEs. In addition, we will establish groups of three to four people to work together on one of the proposed projects. Each group must open a public GitHub project that will be linked to this page.

# <a id="initialization"></a> Improving weights initialization
We will explore different methods to initialize weights when solving PDEs. First, we will think of a simple 1D problem with a ReLU Neural Network, and then we will extend it to the 2D case.
# <a id="fols"></a> First Order System Least Squares
Following [J. A. Opschoor, P. C. Petersen, C. Schwab (2024). First Order System Least Squares Neural Networks. arXiv preprint arXiv:2409.20264.], we propose to implement First Order Least Squares Solver of PDEs.

Following [Z. Aldirany, R. Cottereau, M. Laforest, S. Prudhomme (2024). Multi-level neural networks for accurate solutions of boundary-value problems, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, Volume 419, 116666, ISSN 0045-7825, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2023.116666], we propose to replicate the results replacing the approximation of the PDE solution in the form of a sum of neural networks by a single neural network that is iteratively retrained.
